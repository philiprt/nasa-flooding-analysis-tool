# NASA Flooding Analysis Tool

This repository contains a public copy of the code needed to reproduce the [NASA Flooding Analysis Tool](https://sealevel.nasa.gov/flooding-analysis-tool/). The primary repository for the tool is a private NASA-owned repository, so this repository may not reflect the most up-to-date version of the online tool.

**Note:** The necessary files for viewing results from all locations are not included due to the collective size of those files. Data files for Honolulu, HI are included for testing purposes.
